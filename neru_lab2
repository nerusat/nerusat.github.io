        <h2>Courses and Programs</h2>
        <p>
            During my time at ABC University, I pursued a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. The program
            provided a comprehensive understanding of various aspects of computer science, including software
            development, algorithms, and data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            One course that stood out to me was "Web Development Fundamentals." This course not only taught me the
            technical skills required for building web applications but also emphasized the importance of user
            experience and design principles. The practical projects in this course honed my problem-solving skills
            and sparked my passion for front-end development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Most Useful Course:</strong> "Web Development Fundamentals"
        </p>
        <p>
            This course equipped me with the skills to create user-friendly and aesthetically pleasing websites. The
            hands-on projects challenged me to think critically and creatively, making it the most useful course in
            shaping my career path.

        <h2>Educational Awards</h2>
        <p>
            I am proud to have received the "Outstanding Academic Achievement Award" during my final year at ABC
            University. This award recognized my dedication to academic excellence and my contributions to group
            projects within the computer science department.

        <h2>Extra-Curricular Activities</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Member of the Computer Science Club</li>
            <li>Volunteered for coding workshops in local schools</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Engaging in extra-curricular activities allowed me to apply my classroom knowledge in real-world
            scenarios. It also provided opportunities to collaborate with peers and expand my network within the
            technology community.
